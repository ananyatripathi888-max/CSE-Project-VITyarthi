# CSE-Project-VITyarthi
This project is a Python-based compound interest calculator designed to assist users in precisely estimating the future value of their savings or investments using the compound interest formula. 

Overview of the Project
This project is a simple and interactive Compound Interest Calculator that allows users to estimate the future value of an investment based on principal amount, annual interest rate, compounding frequency, and time period. The tool helps users understand how compound interest can grow their savings or investments over time.

Features
•	Compound interest is computed using a standard mathematical formula.
•	Principal, rate, time period, and compounding frequency (annual, semi-annual, quarterly, monthly, or daily) are among the various inputs that can be entered.
•	Both the final investment amount and the total interest accrued are provided.
•	Verifies input values and manages edge cases, such as inputs that are zero or negative.
•	A command line interface that is easy to use for data entry.


Technologies/Tools Used
- Python (standard library)
- Tested on Python 3.8+
~VS code

Steps to Install & Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
3. Run the script:
python compound_interest_calculator.py

Instructions for Testing
- Enter valid values when prompted for principal, annual interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.
- After calculation, verify output with known compound interest examples (use manual calculations or trusted online sources to compare results).
- Try out edge cases (zero or negative inputs) to observe input validation features.
